# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning
Welcome to the Pneumonia Detection project! This repository contains code and resources for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using advanced deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop a robust CNN model that assists healthcare professionals in accurate and early pneumonia diagnosis.
Project Overview :
Pneumonia is a life-threatening respiratory infection, but its impact can be significantly reduced through early detection and timely treatment. This project uses convolutional neural networks to:

Analyze chest X-ray images automatically :
Classify images as pneumonia or normal with high accuracy
Provide healthcare professionals with reliable diagnostic support
Achieve optimal sensitivity and specificity for clinical applications

Data :
The dataset used for this project consists of chest X-ray images organized into pneumonia and normal cases. The images are preprocessed and resized to 150x150 pixels for optimal model performance.

Model Architecture :
The deep learning model consists of the following key components:

Convolutional Layers: 5 Conv2D layers with progressive filter complexity (32→64→64→128→256)
Batch Normalization: Applied after each convolutional layer for training stability
Dropout Regularization: Strategic placement (0.1→0.2→0.2→0.2) to prevent overfitting
MaxPooling Layers: For spatial dimension reduction and feature extraction
Dense Layers: Fully connected layer (128 units) with final sigmoid activation
Data Augmentation: Rotation, zoom, and shift transformations for improved generalization

Key Features :

Advanced CNN Architecture: Multi-layer convolutional network optimized for medical imaging
Regularization Techniques: Batch normalization and dropout for robust performance
Data Augmentation: Comprehensive augmentation strategy to handle dataset imbalance
Learning Rate Scheduling: ReduceLROnPlateau callback for optimal convergence
Clinical Metrics: Focus on sensitivity and specificity for medical applications
Comprehensive Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification reports, and visualization tools

Performance Metrics :

The model is evaluated using clinically relevant metrics:
Sensitivity (Recall): Ability to correctly identify pneumonia cases
Specificity: Ability to correctly identify normal cases
Accuracy: Overall classification performance
Precision: Reliability of positive predictions
F1-Score: Balanced measure of precision and recall
